                <p>During College of Charleston's spring semester 2012, they both enrolled in "Historian's Craft,"
                    one of the core courses for the History major. For the first month or so, they sat next to each other
                    without ever exchanging words. Then one day, Maddi forgot to print out the reading and their professor
                    made them share the reading that Parker remembered to print out. From then on, Maddi and Parker spent
                    time together in between classes and studied together in the library. Their first date was a superbowl
                    party, during which the New York Giants beat the New England Patriots. Soon after, Parker and Maddi began
                    seriously dating.

                <p>After 5 years of dating, Parker asked Maddi to marry him in the Unitarian Church cemetery garden on May 8th, 2016. Afterwards,
                    the two celebrated their engagement at their favorite brewery with some of their closest friends.  3 months 
                    later, they moved to New Jersey where Maddi currently studies at Rutgers University and Parker works
                    at AT&T.  The two look forward to tying the knot on June 2nd,
                    2018 in their beloved city of Charleston, South Carolina.
